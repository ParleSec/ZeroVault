## Project Overview

**ZeroVault** is a lightweight cryptographic vault designed for encrypting and verifying sensitive documents using modern, secure encryption primitives. The vault uses AES-256-GCM for symmetric encryption and Ed25519 for digital signatures. It is written in Rust and offers cryptographic integrity, password-based key derivation (via Argon2), and support for secure serialization of encrypted artifacts.

## Purpose & Motivation

### Why ZeroVault Exists

Digital file protection requires a blend of confidentiality, integrity, and ease of use. ZeroVault aims to:

- Provide strong encryption using modern ciphers and key derivation
- Offer digital signature verification to detect tampering
- Simplify encryption/decryption processes via a CLI-based toolchain
- Be usable for SPII and document workflows

ZeroVault is particularly useful for developers and professionals seeking a verifiable and deterministic mechanism for protecting sensitive files during transmission or at rest.

## Architecture

### System Structure

- `vault_core`: Core cryptographic logic
- `cli`: Command-line interface for using the vault
- `types.rs`: Custom serializable types including encryption metadata
- `main.rs`: Entrypoint for CLI application

### Cryptographic Components

- **AES-GCM (256-bit)**: Symmetric encryption algorithm for confidentiality & integrity
- **Argon2id**: Password-based key derivation function with salt for secure key material
- **Ed25519**: Signature scheme to provide authenticity and non-repudiation

## Key Features

### üîê Secure Encryption

- Random nonces and salts per encryption
- Key derived from password using Argon2id
- Ciphertext authenticated with AES-GCM

### üßæ Digital Signatures

- Signing of ciphertext with Ed25519 private key
- Signature verification using embedded public key

### üîÅ Serialization

- Metadata (nonce, salt, signature, pubkey, ciphertext) encoded to Base64
- Encrypted data structure: `EncryptedData`

## Example Code

```rust
let keypair = SigningKey::generate(&mut OsRng);
let enc = encrypt_data(b"my secret data", "mypassword");
let result = decrypt_data(&enc, "mypassword").unwrap();
```

## Crates & Dependencies

- `aes-gcm` ‚Äì AES-256-GCM authenticated encryption
- `argon2` ‚Äì Secure key derivation (Argon2id)
- `base64` ‚Äì Encoding for serialized outputs
- `ed25519-dalek` ‚Äì Key generation & signature scheme
- `rand` ‚Äì CSPRNG (OsRng)
- `serde` / `serde_json` ‚Äì Serialization

## Usage & CLI

ZeroVault CLI for encrypting and decrypting files via terminal interface.

```bash
# Encrypt a file
zerovault encrypt --input file.pdf --output file.vault

# Decrypt
zerovault decrypt --input file.vault --output file.pdf
```

## Future Plans

- üîí CLI file encryption with vault format
- üìú Public key export/import support
- üì§ Secure upload & retrieval workflows (REST API?)
- üíº Integration into secure document management systems (SecureVault?)
